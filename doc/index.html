<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.  The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor data types.  Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.</p>

<p>As for database of hash table, each key must be unique within a database, so it is impossible to store two or more records with a key overlaps.  The following access methods are provided to the database: storing a record with a key and a value, deleting a record by a key, retrieving a record by a key.  Moreover, traversal access to every key are provided, although the order is arbitrary.  These access methods are similar to ones of DBM (or its followers: NDBM and GDBM) library defined in the UNIX standard.  Tokyo Cabinet is an alternative for DBM because of its higher performance.</p>

<p>Tokyo Cabinet is written in C, and provided as API of C.  Tokyo Cabinet is available on platforms which have API conforming to POSIX.  Tokyo Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
